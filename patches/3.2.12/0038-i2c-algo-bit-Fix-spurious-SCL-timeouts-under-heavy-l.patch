Subject: [PATCH 38/42] i2c-algo-bit: Fix spurious SCL timeouts under heavy
 load

commit 8ee161ce5e0cfc689eb677f227a6248191165fac upstream.

When the system is under heavy load, there can be a significant delay
between the getscl() and time_after() calls inside sclhi(). That delay
may cause the time_after() check to trigger after SCL has gone high,
causing sclhi() to return -ETIMEDOUT.

To fix the problem, double check that SCL is still low after the
timeout has been reached, before deciding to return -ETIMEDOUT.
